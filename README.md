### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Diversifying Talent in Quantum Computing (DTQC) GitHub Repository!

- ðŸ”­ We are a K-12 capacity building initiative around making quantum computing an accessible field of study and work for all people!
- ðŸŒ± We run quantum computing themed workshops, local events, summer camps, high school courses, and more!
- ðŸ‘¯ We also develop our own custom-built educational tools to help anybody get started in learning about this exciting field, no matter your background or experience level :)
- ðŸ¤” The team is always looking for volunteers, so if you're interested in software development, curriculum design, or EDI, reach out!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask us about our quantum computing apps, working at a non-profit, or about one of our many upcoming educational workshops!
- ðŸ“« How to reach us: Email us at quantum.geeringup@ubc.ca!
- ðŸ˜„ Equity, Diversity and Inclusion: We are all about EDI and breaking down barriers of entry for underrepresented groups. If you'd like to collaborate, reach out!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Our team is working on the first publicly available mobile application that interacts with a _real_ quantum computer! Available on iOS and Android.
